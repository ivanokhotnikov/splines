# Splines calculator according to ISO 4156-1:2005

The repository contains the splines.py module and the test_splines.py. The former introduces the `Splines` class with methods to calculate the key sizes of internal and external splines according to ISO 4156-2:2001. The latter implements the tests of the calculations by comparing the calculated sizes with the example calculations annexed to ISO 4156-1:2005. The `Splines` class is initiated with the spline specification as a string in the format according to the section 12.3 of ISO 4156-1:2001. For example, the input for the external spline calculation would look like: `'EXT 24z x 2,5m x 30R x 5f - ISO 4156'`. The `print_drawing_data` method lists the drawing data according to thr section 12.4 ISO 4156-1:2001, which is the uniform specification of the splines required on the drawing of the component.
