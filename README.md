# Splines

The repository contains the `splines` and `test_splines` modules. The former is the splines calculator, which uses the sizes calculation methodology described in ISO 4156-1:2005. The `splines` introduces the `Splines` class with methods to calculate the key sizes of internal and external splines according to ISO 4156-2:2001. The `test_splines` implements the tests of the calculations by drawing a comparison between the sizes computed with the `splines` module and the sizing calculation examples in appendices to ISO 4156-1:2005. The `Splines` class is initiated with the spline string specification in the format according to the section 12.3 of ISO 4156-1:2001. For example, the input for the external spline calculation would look like: `'EXT 24z x 2,5m x 30R x 5f - ISO 4156'`. The `print_drawing_data` method lists the data required for the uniform spline specification on drawings of the spined components according to the section 12.4 in ISO 4156-1:2001.
